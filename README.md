CoBaLT
------

CoBaLT is an application in which a corpus of texts can be loaded so as to be able to annotate its tokens (lemmatize and more). The annotation work in CoBaLT gives two products: an annotated corpus, and a lexicon consisting of word forms and their corresponding lemmata and such assigned to them.
